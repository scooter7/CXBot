Chatbot response: 
It is possible that undergraduate and graduate programs may have different requirements, prerequisites, qualifications, and acceptance rates. It is best to research the specific program you are interested in to determine the exact requirements and criteria for admission. Additionally, it is important to consider the cost of attending the program, as there may be hidden fees or discrepancies in tuition for different program formats. Financial aid and scholarship opportunities should also be researched to determine if there are any available for the program you are interested in.
