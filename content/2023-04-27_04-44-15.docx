Ronni (r.onnie@s.org): Why is SEO important for colleges?
Chatbot response: 
SEO is important for colleges because it helps them increase their visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs). Optimizing their websites for SEO can help them appear in special SERP features such as the local pack, college pack, and college cards. Additionally, optimizing their websites for sitelinks can increase their click-through rate (CTR) and improve user experience. Furthermore, optimizing images and creating content that answers questions can help them appear in Google's "People Also Ask" feature or rich snippet position. All of these strategies can help colleges increase their visibility and reach more potential students.
