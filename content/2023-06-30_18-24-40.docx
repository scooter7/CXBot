J (j@a.com): What are the reasons that they want four-year degrees?
Chatbot response: 
The reasons that people want four-year degrees are to have time to do activities they normally couldn't do during the year, such as traveling, internships, volunteer work, etc. Additionally, some people prefer in-person classes and don't do as well in online classes, so a four-year degree with regular breaks allows them to retain the information better and ask more questions. Finally, some people need complete breaks to decompress and maintain their work ethic.
