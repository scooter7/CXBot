Tom (t@om.net): Why is SEO important for colleges?
Chatbot response: 
SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is important for colleges because it allows them to get in front of prospective students when they are searching for information about a degree without a school already in mind. By optimizing their website for non-branded keywords, colleges and universities can increase their visibility in search engine results and build brand awareness and connection with prospective students. Additionally, SEO can help colleges and universities create a positive impression with prospective students by ensuring that their website design is attractive and engaging.
