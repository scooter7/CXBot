Ricky (r@icky.net): How shouldcolleges optimize their sites?
Chatbot response: 
Colleges should optimize their sites by focusing on optimizing their websites for sitelinks. Sitelinks give users the opportunity to click through to different areas of the site, increasing click-through rate (CTR) and improving user experience. To appear for sitelinks, the website should have a clear and intuitive information architecture and the content should be housed properly under the correct folders. Additionally, colleges should optimize their images by including keywords in the file name, title text, and alt text, and compressing the images to decrease load time. Colleges should also claim and optimize their Google Business Profiles to increase visibility in local search results and increase inclusion in special SERP features. Finally, colleges should optimize their content for questions and answers to increase the chances of appearing in Google's "People Also Ask" feature or rich snippet position.
