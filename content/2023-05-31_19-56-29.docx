J (j@test.org): What should I do if I get rejected to my desired college?
Chatbot response: 
If you get rejected to your desired college, it is important to re-evaluate your applications and look through your college application stats. You can also consider applying to other schools with rolling admission policies. Additionally, you can write an appeal letter to the college's admission team to show your interest and dedication to the school's vision. There is no guarantee that the college will reverse their decision, but it is worth a try.
