Tony (t@ony.net): What audiences get the most spend allocated to them in terms of ad dollars?
Chatbot response: 
It is difficult to answer this question without prior knowledge. However, based on the context information provided, it is likely that higher education institutions are allocating more ad dollars to audiences that are more likely to engage with personalized content. This could include audiences that have expressed an interest in the institution's programs, those that have visited the website multiple times, and those that have interacted with the institution's content in the past.
