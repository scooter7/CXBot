J (j@a.com): Why do people prefer four year degrees?
Chatbot response: 
People prefer four year degrees because it allows them to have regular breaks to relax, travel, and spend time with family and friends. It also allows them to have the traditional college experience, with summers off to come home and see family. Additionally, four year degrees provide more opportunities for internships, volunteer work, and other activities that may not be available during the school year. Finally, some people find that they retain information better in in-person classes than online classes.
