Hank (h@anj.net): Why is SEO important for colleges?
Chatbot response: 
SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is important for colleges because it allows them to increase their visibility in search engine results. This is especially important for colleges that don't have a strong brand affinity, as students are more likely to perform non-branded searches when looking for schools. By optimizing their website for non-branded keywords, colleges can get in front of students when they are top-of-funnel and start to build that brand awareness and connection with them. Additionally, SEO can help colleges create a better user experience on their website, which can impact a student's impression of the university and potentially influence their decision-making process.
