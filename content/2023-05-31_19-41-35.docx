Subject: Improve Lead Generation with Slate Request for Information Forms

Dear [Name],

Are you looking for ways to capture leads more effectively for your college or university and improve the performance of your digital ad campaigns? We have some tips to share with you!

First, shorten your landing page RFI forms. Prospects don't have time to sift through lots of information, so it's best to keep it short when it comes to copy. Include no more than three fields on your landing page RFI forms, such as name, birthdate, and email.

Second, start using Slate form communications. This will streamline your lead capture process while keeping your landing page RFI form as short as possible. You can build trust with your prospects by not asking them for sensitive information up front, give them a sense of control, and segment your audiences and personalize future communications.

Finally, here are some strategies for success with Slate forms: explain why your school is asking for additional information and what benefits students will receive in return for sharing it, prioritize Yes/No questions, and reassure prospective students that the second RFI form is short and will only take up a little of their time.

We hope these tips help you capture
