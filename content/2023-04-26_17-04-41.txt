Jake (J@g.com): What are SEO best practices?
Chatbot response: 
SEO best practices include optimizing your website for sitelinks, optimizing images for search results, claiming and optimizing your Google Business Profile, and optimizing content for questions and answers. When optimizing for sitelinks, you should have a clear and intuitive information architecture and content should be housed properly under the correct folders. When optimizing images, you should include keywords in the file name, title text, and alt text, and always compress your images to decrease load time. When optimizing your Google Business Profile, you should ensure that you have claimed and optimized all of your Google Business Profiles, including any different schools or departments within the institution. When optimizing content for questions and answers, you can build entire pieces of content around answering a single question, or you can work multiple questions and answers into a page.
