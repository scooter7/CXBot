Scotty (s@c.info): What are best practices for ranking highly?
Chatbot response: 
The best practices for ranking highly in search engine results are to have a strong SEO strategy that is “always on” and to create a lot of relevant content about the topic. This content should include a variety of pages such as a careers page, student profiles, curriculum page, and pages for each concentration. Additionally, it is important to include the most relevant information on the first page of search results, as most people do not scroll past the first page. Optimizing for a variety of search terms can also help to increase rankings.
