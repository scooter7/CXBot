Fred (f@red.org): Why is seo important for undergraduate programs?
Chatbot response: 
SEO is important for undergraduate programs because it helps them appear higher in search engine results, which increases the chances of prospective students finding and clicking on their link. Optimizing title tags and meta descriptions with keywords and relevant information can help draw attention to the program and entice users to click on the link. Additionally, clearly delineating degree designation and delivery format in the metadata can help prospective students quickly determine if the program is the right fit for them.
