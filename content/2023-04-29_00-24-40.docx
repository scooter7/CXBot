Ralph (r@a.net): What do students expect since the pandemic?
Chatbot response: 
Students expect reassurance from their college of choice that they will be safe during a pandemic, including measures and closure plans in place if another pandemic were to occur. They also want more information about financial aid, what to bring and how to prepare, and academic planning.
