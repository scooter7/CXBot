Dee (c@a.org): What were the key findings?
Chatbot response: 
The key findings from the study were that organizational trust, empowerment, support for innovation, and interpersonal conflict all had a significant impact on resistance to change in HBCUs. Additionally, the Path Model of Organizational Trust was found to be a valid and reliable measure of trust in the HBCU context.
