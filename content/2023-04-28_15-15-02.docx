Merv (merv@as.net): Can you put those recommendations into a bullet list?
Chatbot response: 
Yes, the recommendations can be put into a bullet list as follows: 
• Provide detailed information about a degree program’s curriculum, including specific courses needed, the material that is covered, class structure, class size, and more. 
• Provide a road map or example course of study that shows what classes have to be taken in what order and what the course load would look like for the entire length of the program. 
• Ensure that each page has at least 500 words of content. 
• Do not withhold information from the website in order to force prospects to reach out. 
• Provide prospects with all the information they need to make their decision on where to apply and enroll.
