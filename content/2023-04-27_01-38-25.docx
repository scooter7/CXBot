Murph (m@urph): are undergraduate and graduate programs different in terms of what to optimize for?
Chatbot response: 
Yes, undergraduate and graduate programs should be optimized differently. For example, the title tag and meta description for a graduate program should clearly state the degree designation (e.g. "Master's" or "PhD"), while the title tag and meta description for an undergraduate program should not include this information. Furthermore, each delivery format for a program should have its own page, and the title tag and meta description should clearly state the delivery format (e.g. "Online Part-Time MBA Program" vs. "On-Campus Full-Time MBA Program"). Additionally, keyword research should be performed to gain a better understanding of how prospects are searching for a particular program, and the program page should be optimized for the most popular search terms.
