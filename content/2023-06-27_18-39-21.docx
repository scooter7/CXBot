J (j@a.com): Who is Dennis Whelan?
Chatbot response: 
Dennis Whelan, also known as Vaylin, is a ne'er-do-well who is known for his unsuccessful career and lack of basketball skills. He is known to spend a lot of time in bars, particularly the Marriott bar, and is known to have once spent more money in the LAX bar than the revenue generated from a project which Viney sold for him in California. In the TWG Plus org chart, he was situated somewhere between Bartling and 3 Little Letters. His fashion sense includes a proclivity for track pants, stinky sneakers, and a plug for his twenty.
