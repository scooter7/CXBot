Merv (m@erv.net): Describe the benefits of SEO for universities
Chatbot response: 
Search engine optimization (SEO) can be a powerful tool for universities to increase their visibility and reach prospective students. SEO involves optimizing a website to appear higher in search engine results, which can help universities get in front of students when they are searching for information about a degree without a school already in mind. By optimizing their website for non-branded keywords, universities can increase their chances of appearing in the top search results and build brand awareness and connection with students. Additionally, SEO can help universities create a positive impression with prospective students by ensuring that their website design is attractive and engaging.
