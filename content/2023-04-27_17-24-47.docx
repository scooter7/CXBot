Scotty (s@c.info): Can you turn that into a bullet list?
Chatbot response: 
• Clear page listing all majors and minors, using terminology that prospects understand
• Clearly indicate degree type (BA, MA, etc.)
• Clearly delineate which campuses offer which programs
• Sample schedule of classes needed to be taken within a major and in what order for all four years
• More in-depth information about the program, including available dual degree options and concentrations
