James (j@test.com): Why is SEO important?
Chatbot response: 
SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is important because it helps ensure that your website is visible to potential customers when they search for relevant keywords. SEO helps you optimize your website content, including keywords in the page's body copy, header tags, and metadata, so that it is more likely to appear in search engine results. Additionally, SEO can help you choose names for new programs that are in line with how users are searching for that type of degree, and can help you use the right terminology in the page's content to grab those searches. By optimizing your website for SEO, you can make sure that the right page is showing up for the right keywords, and that your website is more visible to potential customers.
