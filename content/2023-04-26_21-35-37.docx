Ricard (r@a.net): What doe colleges need to do for SEO?
Chatbot response: 
Colleges need to do several things to optimize their SEO. They should place a focus on optimizing their websites for sitelinks, which give users the opportunity to click through to different areas of the site. This requires a clear and intuitive information architecture and content housed properly under the correct folders. Additionally, they should optimize their images by including keywords in the file name, title text, and alt text, and compress the images to decrease load time. They should also claim and optimize their Google Business Profiles, as this will increase their visibility in local search results and increase their inclusion in special SERP features. Finally, they should optimize their content for questions and answers, as this increases their chances of appearing in Google's "People Also Ask" feature or rich snippet position.
