Guy (guy@smiley.org): What are the main motivators for students since the pandemic?
Chatbot response: 
The main motivators for students since the pandemic are learning outcomes and future career goals. Nearly two-thirds of respondents were more intrinsically motivated to attend college than extrinsically motivated. Other motivational areas such as society, personal growth, and financial security were also selected as important by a significant portion of respondents.
