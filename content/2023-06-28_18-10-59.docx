J (j@a.net): How do people feel about 3 or 4 year degree options?
Chatbot response: 
People generally have different opinions about 3 or 4 year degree options. Some people prefer a three year degree because it allows them to pursue graduate school or work more quickly and with added flexibility and choice. Others prefer a four year degree because it allows them to enjoy their breaks and have more time to spend with loved ones, as well as get a job for a bit. Some people prefer online classes, while others prefer in-person classes. Ultimately, it depends on the individual's learning style, goals, and preferences.
