Ronni (r.onnie@s.org): How can a college's website rank high in Google?
Chatbot response: 
In order to rank high in Google, a college's website should focus on optimizing for non-branded keywords, such as those related to the college's programs and location. Additionally, the website should be designed in a way that is visually appealing and user-friendly, as this can have a moderate impact on a user's impression of the university. The website should also be optimized for the most popular search engines, such as Google, Bing, Yahoo!, DuckDuckGo, and Yandex. This can be done by following the best practices of each search engine. Finally, the website should be regularly updated with fresh content, as this can help to improve its ranking in search engine results.
