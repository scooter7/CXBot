J (j@a.net): What are the main reasons why?
Chatbot response: 
The main reasons why someone might prefer a four year degree with regular breaks over a three year degree with online classes are: 
1. Having something to look forward to can help them move past challenges and it gives them time to spend with loved ones. 
2. Online classes can be difficult to learn from, and some people prefer in-person classes. 
3. A four year degree allows for more time to rest and avoid burnout. 
4. A four year degree allows for more time to enjoy free time instead of potentially burning oneself out.
