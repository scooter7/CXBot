Chatbot response: 
The keys to having good SEO for a college website are optimizing the website for sitelinks, optimizing images for search results, claiming and optimizing Google Business Profiles, and optimizing content for questions and answers. Optimizing the website for sitelinks involves having a clear and intuitive information architecture and housing content properly under the correct folders. Image optimization involves including keywords in the file name, title text, and alt text, as well as compressing images to decrease load time. Optimizing content for questions and answers increases the chances of appearing in Google’s “People Also Ask” feature or rich snippet position.
