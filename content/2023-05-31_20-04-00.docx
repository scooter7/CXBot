The answer to this question depends on your individual goals and preferences. It is important to consider the academic, social, and financial aspects of attending college with a friend. Consider researching the colleges you are interested in to determine if they offer the academic programs and extracurricular activities that you are looking for. Additionally, consider the cost of attending college with a friend and if it is financially feasible.
