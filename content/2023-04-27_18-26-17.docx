Jay (j@v.net): What do students prefer since the pandemic?
Chatbot response: 
Since the pandemic, students have shown an increased focus on campus safety, selectivity, campus feel, and scholarships/aid when considering colleges. They have also expressed less interest in online education than before the pandemic, as most institutions have returned to in-person classes.
