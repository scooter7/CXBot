J (h@a.net): what have people been asking about?
Chatbot response: 
People have been asking about the activities available within different colleges, what they can do outside of the bounds of campus, a lack of information about programs, a sample schedule of what classes need to be taken within a major and in what order for all four years, and more detailed information about the program, including available dual degree options and concentrations.
