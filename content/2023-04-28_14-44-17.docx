Ralph (r@alph.net): How can colleges rank high?
Chatbot response: 
Colleges can rank high by providing prospective students with the information they need to make an informed decision about their college choice. This includes providing detailed information about the admissions process, such as the ratio of applicants to admitted students, the average GPA and SAT/ACT scores of those admitted, and career outcomes information such as what makes the school's programs different from other schools, what careers the degree is applicable to, and the average salary for those careers. Additionally, colleges should provide resources to help students explore different career paths, and provide information about the teaching style and how the program has affected graduates outside of their pay.
