Tim (t@im.org): Describe SEO best practices for colleges
Chatbot response: 
Colleges should focus on optimizing their websites for SEO best practices in order to increase visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs). This includes optimizing content for keywords, optimizing images, creating a Google Business Profile, and optimizing content for questions and answers. 

When optimizing content for keywords, colleges should research relevant keywords and incorporate them into their content in a natural way. This will help the website appear in SERPs for relevant searches. 

Image optimization is also important for SEO. This includes including keywords in the file name, title text, and alt text, as well as compressing images to decrease load time. 

Creating and optimizing a Google Business Profile is also important for SEO. This will increase visibility in local search results and increase the chances of appearing in special SERP features such as the local pack, college pack, and college cards. 

Finally, optimizing content for questions and answers is an excellent SEO strategy. This will increase the chances of appearing in Google’s “People Also Ask” feature or rich snippet position. Colleges should build entire pieces of content around answering a single question, or work multiple questions and answers into a page.
