ZZ (zz@top.net): Why should I care about SEO?
Chatbot response: 
Search engine optimization (SEO) is an important tool for colleges and universities to reach prospective students. By optimizing their website for non-branded keywords, colleges and universities can get in front of students when they are top-of-funnel and start to build brand awareness and connection with them. Additionally, the design of a website can have a moderate impact on a student's impression of the university, so SEO can help ensure that students have a positive impression of the university when they visit the website.
