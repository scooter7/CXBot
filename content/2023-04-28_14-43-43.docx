Ralph (r@alph.net): Why is seo important for colleges?
Chatbot response: 
SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is important for colleges because it helps them to appear higher in search engine results, which increases the chances of prospective students finding their website. This is especially important since the majority of respondents in the survey indicated that they use Google to search for information about a degree without a school already in mind. By optimizing their website for non-branded keywords, colleges and universities have the opportunity to get in front of students when they are top-of-funnel and start to build that brand awareness and connection with them. Additionally, the design of a website can also impact a student's impression of the university, so SEO can also help to ensure that the website is designed in a way that is attractive and engaging to prospective students.
