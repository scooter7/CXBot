Mick (m@icl.edu): What about for graduate programs?
Chatbot response: 
Mick, prospective graduate students want to know the prerequisites, qualifications, and undergraduate grades they need to be accepted into a program, as well as standardized test requirements, acceptance rate, and the size of each incoming cohort. They also want to know how to contact advisors who work specifically with graduate students or how to set up a department-specific meeting with a program head, professor, or current graduate student. Additionally, they want step-by-step instructions on how to apply to a specific program, clear dates of when the application opens and closes, and access to a practice exam if there is an admissions exam. International students want to know specific international admissions requirements, fees, expenses, sponsorship opportunities, and processes for obtaining a visa. Furthermore, they want clear information about tuition/fees/scholarships and details about financial aid and scholarships.
