James (h@asd.org): What is SEO for higher education?
Chatbot response: 
SEO (Search Engine Optimization) for higher education is the process of optimizing a college or university's website to increase its visibility in search engine results. This includes optimizing content, keywords, and other elements to make the website more attractive to search engines and more likely to appear in the top results for relevant searches. SEO for higher education can help colleges and universities reach prospective students who are searching for information about a degree without a school already in mind. By optimizing their website for non-branded keywords, colleges and universities can get in front of students when they are top-of-funnel and start to build that brand awareness and connection with them. Additionally, optimizing a website for SEO can help create a positive impression of the university, as the design of a website can have a moderate impact on a user's impression of the university.
