Ralph (r@a.net): Why should colleges engage in seo?
Chatbot response: 
Colleges should engage in SEO in order to increase their visibility in search engine results and reach prospective students who are searching for information about degrees without a school already in mind. By optimizing their website for non-branded keywords, colleges can get in front of students when they are top-of-funnel and start to build brand awareness and connection with them. Additionally, SEO can help colleges create a better user experience on their website, which can impact a student's impression of the university.
