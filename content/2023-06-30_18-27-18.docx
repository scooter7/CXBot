Chatbot response: 
Dear J,

Thank you for expressing interest in a three year degree. We understand that you want to pursue a degree quickly and affordably, and we believe that a three year degree is the best option for you.

A three year degree allows you to pursue graduate school or work more quickly, giving you added flexibility and choice. You can also take summer courses to help you complete your degree faster. Additionally, you can save money on tuition and other expenses associated with a four year degree.

We hope that this information has been helpful in making your decision. Please let us know if you have any further questions.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
