James (j@s.org): Why is SEO important?
Chatbot response: 
SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is important because it helps ensure that your website is visible to potential customers when they search for relevant keywords. SEO helps you optimize your website for the most popular search terms, including keywords in the page’s body copy, header tags, and metadata. This helps ensure that your website is more likely to show up in search engine results, increasing the chances of potential customers finding your website. Additionally, SEO can help you choose names for new programs that are in line with how users are searching for that type of degree, and can help you use the right terminology in the page’s content to grab those searches.
