Ralph (r@wsd.com): Why is SEO important in higher education marketing?
Chatbot response: 
SEO is important in higher education marketing because it allows colleges and universities to get in front of prospective students when they are searching for information about a degree without a school already in mind. By optimizing their website for non-branded keywords, colleges and universities can increase their visibility in search engine results and build brand awareness and connection with prospective students. Additionally, SEO can help ensure that students have a positive experience when they click through to a college or university's website, as the design of the website can have a moderate impact on a student's impression of the university.
