James (h@asd.org): Is SEO important for marketing?
Chatbot response: 
Yes, SEO is important for marketing. SEO stands for search engine optimization, which is the process of optimizing a website to increase its visibility in search engine results. By optimizing your website for non-branded keywords, you can get in front of potential customers when they are searching for related topics and products. Additionally, optimizing your website for popular search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo can help ensure that your website is seen by the most people.
