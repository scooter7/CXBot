Tony (t@ony.net): What are the best online advertising strategies for colleges?
Chatbot response: 
The best online advertising strategies for colleges will depend on the type of graduate programs they offer and the delivery format. Colleges should focus on creating content that is tailored to each delivery format, such as on-campus, online, and hybrid. This content should be easily accessible and organized in a way that is easy to navigate. Additionally, colleges should consider using advanced tracking tools such as Carnegie Clarity to serve up personalized messaging to prospective students in real-time. This will help ensure that the content is tailored to the individual needs of each prospective student. Finally, colleges should consider using social media platforms to reach potential students and engage with them in meaningful conversations.
