SEO is important for colleges because it helps them increase their visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs). By optimizing their websites for SEO, colleges can appear higher in search engine rankings, which can lead to more organic traffic and increased brand awareness. Additionally, SEO can help colleges appear in special SERP features such as the local pack, college pack, and college cards, which can further increase their visibility and help them stand out from the competition. SEO can also help colleges appear in Google's "People Also Ask" feature or rich snippet position, which can help them answer questions that potential students may have. Finally, SEO can help colleges optimize their images, which can increase their presence in image results and grab the user's attention.
