Dude (d@ude.com): Why should colleges care about SEO?
Chatbot response: 
Colleges should care about SEO because it can help them get in front of prospective students when they are searching for information about a degree without a school already in mind. By optimizing their website for non-branded keywords, colleges can increase their visibility and build brand awareness and connection with students. Additionally, SEO can help colleges ensure that their website design is up to par with user expectations, as 33% of respondents said that the design of a website impacts their impression of the university.
