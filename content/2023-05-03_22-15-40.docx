Yes, colleges should put work into SEO. SEO stands for search engine optimization, and it is a set of strategies and tactics used to increase a website's visibility in search engine results. By optimizing their websites for SEO, colleges can improve their visibility in search engine results, increase their click-through rate (CTR), and improve the user experience. This can be done by optimizing their website's information architecture, content, images, and Google Business Profiles. Additionally, colleges should optimize their content for questions and answers to increase their chances of appearing in Google's "People Also Ask" feature.
