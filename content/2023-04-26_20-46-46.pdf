James (j@ames.com): What should colleges do to have their sites rank high?
Chatbot response: 
Colleges should focus on optimizing their websites for sitelinks, image optimization, Google Business Profiles, and People Also Ask. To optimize for sitelinks, colleges should have a clear and intuitive information architecture and content should be housed properly under the correct folders. For image optimization, colleges should include keywords in the file name, title text, and alt text, and compress images to decrease load time. For Google Business Profiles, colleges should ensure that they have claimed and optimized all of their profiles, including any different locations on campus. For People Also Ask, colleges should optimize their content for questions and answers to increase their chances of appearing in Google's "People Also Ask" feature or rich snippet position.
