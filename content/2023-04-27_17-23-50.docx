Scotty (s@c.info): Why should colleges bother with SEO?
Chatbot response: 
Colleges should bother with SEO because it can help them get in front of prospective students when they are top-of-funnel and start to build brand awareness and connection. SEO can also help colleges and universities optimize their websites for non-branded keywords, which can help them show up in search results and increase their visibility. Additionally, SEO can help create a better user experience on college and university websites, which can help students form a positive impression of the institution and build a sense of belonging.
