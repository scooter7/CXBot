Merv (merv@as.net): What should colleges do to rank high for seo?
Chatbot response: 
Colleges should focus on optimizing their websites for SEO in several ways. First, they should ensure that their website has a clear and intuitive information architecture and that content is housed properly under the correct folders. This will increase the chances of appearing for sitelinks, which can increase CTR and improve user experience. Second, they should optimize their images by including keywords in the file name, title text, and alt text, and compressing the images to decrease load time. Third, they should claim and optimize all of their Google Business Profiles, as this will increase visibility in local search results and increase inclusion in special SERP features. Finally, they should optimize their content for questions and answers, as this will increase the chances of appearing in Google's "People Also Ask" feature or rich snippet position.
