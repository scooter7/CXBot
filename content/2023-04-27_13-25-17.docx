Hank (h@anj.net): What are best seo practices for colleges?
Chatbot response: 
The best SEO practices for colleges include optimizing their websites for sitelinks, optimizing images for keywords, claiming and optimizing Google Business Profiles, and optimizing content for questions and answers. Sitelinks give users the opportunity to click through to different areas of your site, and optimizing images for keywords can increase visibility in search results and increase inclusion in special SERP features. Optimizing Google Business Profiles will increase visibility in local search results, and optimizing content for questions and answers can increase chances of appearing in Google’s “People Also Ask” feature or rich snippet position.
