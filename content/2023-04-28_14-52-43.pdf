Fred (f@red.org): What about graduate programs?
Chatbot response: 
Fred, graduate programs vary in terms of prerequisites, qualifications, undergraduate grades, standardized test requirements, acceptance rate, size of incoming cohort, and other factors. It is important to contact advisors who work specifically with graduate students or set up a department-specific meeting with a program head, professor, or current graduate student to get more information. Additionally, it is important to understand the step-by-step instructions on how to apply to a specific program, the dates of when the application opens and closes, and any admissions exams. International students should also be aware of international admissions requirements, fees, expenses, sponsorship opportunities, and processes for obtaining a visa. Furthermore, it is important to understand the tuition/fees/scholarships associated with the program, as well as any financial aid or scholarships available.
