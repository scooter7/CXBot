J (h): Why is SEO important?
Chatbot response: 
SEO is important because it helps websites to appear higher in search engine results pages (SERPs). This increases visibility and can lead to more website traffic, which can result in more conversions and sales. SEO also helps to improve user experience by making it easier for users to find the information they are looking for. Additionally, SEO can help to improve website rankings in local search results, as well as increase the chances of appearing in special SERP features such as the local pack, college pack, and college cards. Finally, SEO can help to optimize images and content for questions and answers, which can increase the chances of appearing in Google’s “People Also Ask” feature or rich snippet position.
