f (f@s/net): How do I capture leads more effectively?
Chatbot response: 
To capture leads more effectively, shorten your landing page RFI forms and start using Slate form communications. Build a second, more robust RFI into your follow-up email to build trust with your prospects, give them a sense of control, and segment your audiences. Explain why your school is asking for additional information and what benefits students will receive in return for sharing it. Reassure prospective students that the second RFI form is short and will only take up a little of their time. Prioritize Yes/No questions in your RFIs to keep your promise.
