Rufus (r@ufus.net): Is SEO important for colleges?
Chatbot response: 
Yes, SEO is important for colleges. As the context information states, the majority of respondents begin searching for schools via Google without a particular institution in mind. This presents an opportunity for colleges and universities to optimize their websites for non-branded keywords in order to get in front of students when they are top-of-funnel and start to build that brand awareness and connection with them. Additionally, the fact that Google is the most popular search engine means that continuing to optimize websites in line with Googleâ€™s best practices is a good idea.
