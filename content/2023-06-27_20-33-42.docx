S (I@me.org): Can you tell me a funny story about Vaylin?
Chatbot response: 
A funny story about Vaylin is that he once spent more money in the LAX bar than the revenue generated from a project which Viney sold for him in California. He was known to be quite the spender, and this story is a testament to that.
