Guy (guy@smiley.org): What are the seo implications of that?
Chatbot response: 
The SEO implications of optimizing websites for sitelinks, image optimization, and Google Business Profiles are increased visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs). Sitelinks can increase click-through rate (CTR) and improve user experience, while image optimization can help images appear in featured rich snippets, Google's Discover feed, and image results. Optimizing Google Business Profiles can increase visibility in local search results and increase inclusion in special SERP features such as the local pack, college pack, and college cards. Additionally, optimizing content for questions and answers can increase the chances of appearing in Google's "People Also Ask" feature or rich snippet position.
