J (j@a.com): why do people want three year degrees?
Chatbot response: 
People may want three year degrees because it allows them to pursue graduate school or work more quickly, which can provide them with added flexibility and choice. Additionally, taking summer courses can help them complete their degree faster. Three year degrees can also be more affordable than four year degrees, and can help people get into the workforce sooner.
