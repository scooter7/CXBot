Kim (k@sw.org): Is SEO more important for undergraduates or graduates?
Chatbot response: 
SEO is equally important for both undergraduates and graduates. Prospective students of both levels need to be able to find the information they are looking for quickly and easily. Optimizing title tags and meta descriptions, as well as clearly delineating degree designation and delivery format, are important for both undergraduates and graduates.
