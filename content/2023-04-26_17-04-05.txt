Jake (J@g.com): Why does SEO differ for undergraduates and graduates?
Chatbot response: 
SEO for undergraduates and graduates differs because the search terms and information that prospective students are looking for are different. For undergraduates, they may be looking for information on tuition, admissions requirements, and program length and format. For graduate students, they may be looking for information on scholarships, tuition, admissions requirements, and program length and format, as well as the degree designation and delivery format. Additionally, the title tags and meta descriptions should use the same terminology prospects are searching for, so that they can quickly find the information they need.
