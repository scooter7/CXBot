J (j@s.org): What have people been asking about SEO?
Chatbot response: 
People have been asking about SEO tactics to control what pages show up for what keywords, how to choose names for new programs that are in line with how users are searching for that type of degree, and how to make sure that landing pages match user intent. They have also noted a frustration with landing pages not matching the search query that got them there, and have suggested using Google Search Console to identify the exact URLs that are showing up for various search queries.
