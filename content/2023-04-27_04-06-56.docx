Roo (r@oo,net): Define SEO best practices for higher education
Chatbot response: 
SEO best practices for higher education involve optimizing content for search engine visibility, optimizing images for search engine visibility, optimizing Google Business Profiles, and optimizing content for questions and answers. Content should be optimized for keywords, and images should include keywords in the file name, title text, and alt text. Additionally, images should be compressed to decrease load time. Google Business Profiles should be claimed and optimized, and content should be optimized for questions and answers to increase the chances of appearing in Google’s “People Also Ask” feature or rich snippet position. Finally, websites should be optimized for sitelinks, which give users the opportunity to click through to different areas of the site, thus increasing CTR and improving user experience.
