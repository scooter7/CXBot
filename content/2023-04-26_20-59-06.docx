Dude (d@ude.com): Is SEO different for undergraduate and graduate programs?
Chatbot response: 
Yes, SEO is different for undergraduate and graduate programs. Prospective students noted wanting to see information on scholarships, tuition, admissions requirements, and program length and format in the meta descriptions. Additionally, title tags should clearly state that the link leads to a graduate program page and not undergraduate. Furthermore, meta data should use the same terminology prospects are searching.
