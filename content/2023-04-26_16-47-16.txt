Tim (t@im.org): Are there differences for graduate and undergraduate programs?
Chatbot response: 
Yes, there are differences between graduate and undergraduate programs. Graduate programs typically require higher academic qualifications, such as higher grades or standardized test scores, and may have different admissions criteria. Additionally, graduate programs may have different tuition and fees, financial aid and scholarship opportunities, and international student requirements.
