Vaylin (vaylin@bigcomputer,com): Describe college motivations post-pandemic
Chatbot response: 
Post-pandemic, college motivations have shifted to focus more on factors such as campus safety, selectivity, campus feel, and scholarships/aid. Students are more focused on the scholarships side of net cost, and campus feel continues to climb in importance. Additionally, interest in online education has dipped below pre-pandemic levels, as many institutions have returned to normal, in-person classes. Liberal respondents are more concerned with campus diversity and prestige, while conservative respondents noted athletics.
