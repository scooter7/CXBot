This can be done by optimizing title tags and meta descriptions, using the same terminology prospects are searching, and clearly delineating degree designation and delivery format. SEO can also help universities and colleges attract prospective students by providing information on scholarships, tuition, admissions requirements, and program length and format in the meta description.
