Jay (j@v.net): What should colleges do for good seo?
Chatbot response: 
Colleges should focus on optimizing their websites for sitelinks, image optimization, and Google Business Profiles. They should also make sure to include FAQs on their pages so that they can appear in Google's "People Also Ask" feature or rich snippet position. Additionally, they should ensure that they have claimed and optimized all of their Google Business Profiles, as this will increase their visibility in local search results and increase their inclusion in special SERP features.
