gary (gcolen@carnegiehighered.com): should i then break up with my high school boyfriend when i go to college as a freshman?
Chatbot response: 
This is a personal decision that only you can make. It is important to consider the distance between you and your high school boyfriend, as well as the amount of time you will be able to spend together. You should also think about how your relationship has been going and if it is something you want to continue. Ultimately, it is up to you to decide if you want to stay in the relationship or break up.
