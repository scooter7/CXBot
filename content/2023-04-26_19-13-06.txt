Ziv (z@af.info): Do undergraduate pages have different requirements than graduate pages?
Chatbot response: 
Undergraduate and graduate pages may have different requirements. It is important to check the specific requirements for each program to determine what is needed for admission. Generally, graduate programs may have higher academic requirements, such as higher undergraduate grades, and may also require standardized tests. Additionally, international students may have additional requirements, such as visa applications and fees.
